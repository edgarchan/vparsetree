# Graphical Parse Tree

Simple application that creates a graphical representation of the parse tree generated with the [parboiled](http://parboiled.org/) parsing library. It uses
the [Simple Calculator](https://github.com/sirthias/parboiled/wiki/Simple-Calculator) example grammar provided with parboiled but
should be easy to add a new one.

The web stuff is powered with the [vert.x](http://vertx.io/) framework and [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)
